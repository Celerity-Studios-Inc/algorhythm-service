## Introduction

The NNA Registry Service enables creators to upload and register digital assets across multiple layers, each serving a specific role in video remixing. Your asset descriptions and metadata tags are crucial for **AlgoRhythm**, our AI recommendation engine, to make intelligent suggestions when users start with a song selection.

### How It Works

1. **User selects a song** (e.g., "Shake It Off" by Taylor Swift)
2. **AlgoRhythm analyzes** the song's tempo (120 BPM), genre (Pop), energy (High), mood (Upbeat)
3. **AlgoRhythm recommends compatible assets** from other layers based on your descriptions and tags
4. **Better metadata = Better recommendations = Better user experience**

---

## Understanding AlgoRhythm Recommendations

AlgoRhythm uses a two-tower neural network that analyzes:

### Song Analysis Features

- **Tempo & Rhythm**: BPM, time signature, beat patterns
- **Genre & Style**: Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop, Latin, Electronic, etc.
- **Energy Level**: Low, Medium, High intensity
- **Mood & Emotion**: Happy, Sad, Energetic, Romantic, Aggressive
- **Instrumentation**: Acoustic, Electronic, Orchestra, etc.
- **Cultural Context**: Regional styles, traditional vs. contemporary

### Cross-Layer Compatibility Scoring

AlgoRhythm evaluates how well assets from different layers work together:
- **Stars ‚ÜîÔ∏é Songs**: Performance style matching with musical energy
- **Looks ‚ÜîÔ∏é Stars**: Visual coherence and style consistency
- **Moves ‚ÜîÔ∏é Songs**: Choreography synchronization with tempo and rhythm
- **Worlds ‚ÜîÔ∏é All**: Environmental context that enhances the overall aesthetic

## Core Principles for Effective Metadata

### 1. **Be Specific and Descriptive**

‚ùå "Nice outfit"

‚úÖ "Contemporary streetwear with oversized hoodie, distressed jeans, and high-top sneakers"

### 2. **Include Musical Compatibility Keywords**

For non-song assets, think: "What types of songs would this work well with?"
- Energy levels: energetic, calm, intense, mellow
- Genres: pop-friendly, rock-compatible, hip-hop-suitable
- Moods: upbeat, romantic, dramatic, playful

### 3. **Use Consistent Terminology**

Stick to standard terms that AlgoRhythm recognizes:
- **Tempo**: fast, medium, slow, high-energy, low-energy
- **Style**: contemporary, classic, modern, vintage, futuristic
- **Mood**: happy, sad, energetic, romantic, dramatic, playful

### 4. **Think About User Intent**

Consider how creators will search and what they're trying to achieve:
- "TikTok-ready dance moves"
- "Professional performance look"
- "Vintage concert stage"

## üåü Enhanced Variants System

### Overview

The Enhanced Variants System allows creators to create multiple visual interpretations of the same character or asset while maintaining relationships between them. This system is particularly important for **Stars (S)** and **Looks (L)** layers, where multiple variants of the same character or outfit can exist.

### How Variants Work

1. **Base Asset**: The original character or outfit that defines the core identity
2. **Variants**: Different visual interpretations (different hairstyles, outfits, makeup, etc.)
3. **Relationship**: All variants maintain the same core compatibility and characteristics
4. **AlgoRhythm Integration**: AI can recommend any variant of a character/outfit interchangeably

### Star Variants (S Layer)

#### **Asset Type Selection**
When creating a Star asset, you'll see two options:
- **Base Asset** (Default): The original character

- Include style difference tags
- Maintain compatibility tags from base asset

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Vague Descriptions

‚ÄúNice dance move‚Äù ‚Üí Tells AlgoRhythm nothing about tempo, style, or compatibility

### ‚ùå Missing Energy Indicators

Not including energy levels makes it impossible to match with song intensity

### ‚ùå Genre-Specific Language Only

Using only ‚Äúpop‚Äù without describing visual or performance characteristics

### ‚ùå Overly Technical Language

‚ÄúPolyrhythmic syncopated movements‚Äù ‚Üí Use simpler, more universal terms

### ‚ùå Inconsistent Terminology

Mixing ‚Äúhigh-energy‚Äù and ‚Äúintense‚Äù randomly instead of consistently

### ‚ùå Missing Compatibility Tags

Not including genre-compatibility tags like ‚Äúpop-suitable‚Äù or ‚Äúrock-compatible‚Äù

---
